						<h2>Enter Pattern Lab</h2>
						<blockquote>At its core, <a href="http://patternlab.io/" target="_blank">Pattern Lab</a> is a static site generator (powered by either PHP or Node) that stitches together UI components. But there's a whole lot more to it than that!</blockquote>

						<h2>Pattern Lab as a design system</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Build pattern driven user interfaces using atomic design principles</li>
							<li>Include patterns inside each other to create compenets from consistent building blocks</li>
							<li>Pattern documentation - have the entire team using the same language throughout the entire project</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Pattern Lab as an implementation</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>PHP or node version</li>
							<li>Tool agnostic</li>
							<li>Language agnostic</li>
							<li>Templating engine flexible (Mustache, Twig, Handlebars, etc)</li>
							<li>Viewport resizer, annotations, pattern lineage, and more</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>How it works</h2>
						<p>Create templates, starting with the smallest pieces. Use those patterns to create larger pieces. Again and again.</p>
						<p>You do not need to include all of your data statically. That would be not ideal, because you might want to use a specific template many times within your Pattern Lab project with different data.</p>
						<p>Each template file is also backed by a JSON file that provides the content for the template.</p>
						<p>In short, any time you include a template, you can customize the data being displayed if you desire.</p>

						<h2>Pattern Lab in Drupal</h2>
						<p>Using Pattern Lab in a Drupal 7 project would require maintaining a separate Pattern Lab project. Using same CSS/JS files would require manually maintaining the consistency of templates between the two projects.
						<p>Because Drupal 8 uses Twig as its templating engine, the opportunity to add Pattern Lab to your Drupal project is now a possibility.</p>

						<h2>Drupal 8 and Twig</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Big change for frontend workflow in Drupal 8</li>
							<li>Templating language that adds common templating patterns to PHP projects, learn more about <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/" target="_blank">Twig</a></li>
							<li>All templates in Drupal 8 are .twig files</li>

						Challenges adding Pattern Lab to a Drupal 8 project
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>How it is different in this context than on its own</h2>
						<p>Pattern Lab implements a vanilla project based on whatever templating engine you choose to use. It assumes no dependencies. So, the general way to build more and more complex patterns is to include the simpler patterns within the more complex pattern templates.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>For example</p>
						<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
{% include "atoms-title" %}
{% include "atoms-landscape-16x9" %}
{% include "atoms-body" %}
						</code></pre>
						<p>If you're thinking: "Wait, but that's a problem, because my Drupal templates don't do that!" You're right, it's a problem! And it's in the way of reaching our gold standard goal.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Let's fix it!</h2>
						<p>Wait that seems kind of hard.</p>
						<p>Fortunately, some awesome people have already been thinking about the hard problems. Aleksi Peebles has created a solution for the biggest road block that we're encountering.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Data Transform Plugin</h2>
						<p>As we saw previously, each template file is backed by a JSON file, providing all of the data for the template.</p>
						<p>WELL, now you might be thinking, WHAT IF I can somehow tell Pattern Lab about the patterns I want to include in this JSON file instead of in the template itself. That'd be swell!</p>
						<p></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Special JSON Keys</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><code>attributes()</code> - Compiles the Drupal attributes</li>
							<li><code>include()</code> - Include a template in the specified variable</li>
							<li><code>join()</code> - Join multiple templates together in the specified variable</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The JSON files are processed and these three special keys allow for specific behavior.</p>
						<p>Provides for the cusomization of the attributes var</p>
						<p>Allows simple inclusion of templates in <code>{{ content.field_name }}</code> or <code>{{ content }}</code> vars
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Implementation</h2>
						<p>We've made progress, and we're pretty sure it's going to work, but we're not there yet. There's still a lot to consider and decisions to make when adding Pattern Lab to your project.</p>

				<section>
					An example of my solution
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						Demonstrate a real life example of Pattern Lab in Drupal 8
					</section>
					<section>
						Consider how templates are being used
					</section>
					<section>
						Inspect how JSON data backs the templates
					</section>
					<section>
						Look at how templates are being built into larger pieces
					</section>
					<section>
						Maybe demo adding a new one
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						How/Why is this useful?
					</section>
					<section>
						Decouples the front end from Drupal! You can theme almost completely OUTSIDE of Drupal if you want.
					</section>
					<section>
						Potentially allows a front end to be functionally built out and designed before a committment to sitebuild is made without losing that time
					</section>
					<section>
						Isolates components into the pieces of responsibility outside of the context of Drupal (wrappers, containers, other element classes, etc)
					</section>
					<section>
						Produces a comprehensive styleguide asset!
					</section>
					<section>
						Provides an entire set of data for all your front end components that does not depend on the database. Comprehensive demonstration of all styles for easy visual "regression testing" of sorts. Especially if you are building complicated components, or items that have many moving parts.
					</section>
					<section>
						Connecting communities! Pattern Lab is an existing tool with a lot of dedicated followers. And with the hard work of a few people, a bridge to connect Drupal with this large existing community has been made. That's pretty cool!
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						Why may this be not ideal for every project?
					</section>
					<section>
						Time - Though, through this talk, I hope we determined that with a reasonable setup, the time investment to use this workflow is not that great. For medium/large projects, or projects that are maintained, it can be well worth it, and save more than the time it takes to create
					</section>
					<section>
						More Tools! - Yes, there are more tools to learn and more things to potentially debug. To effectively use this workflow, the dev has to have a reasonable knowledge of PHP, understanding of twig, a strong understanding of Drupal 8 conventions, experience with front end workflow tools (gulp/grunt), maybe some amount of experience with node, and able to debug any of those parts.
					</section>
					<section>
						Too many tools? It depends on your workflow, and your resources. But this is the direction of the Front End developer in the web space. Tools beyond html/css/javascript are par for the course.
					</section>
					<section>
						End to End project workflow - How does your company work? There are a LOT of potential benefits from this type of workflow, but if your entire project process doesn't/can't adjust to position itself to gain from these benefits than you may strictly be weighing the internal dev benefits against the dev costs.
