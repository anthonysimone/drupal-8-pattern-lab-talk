						<h2>Enter Pattern Lab</h2>
						<blockquote>At its core, <a href="http://patternlab.io/" target="_blank">Pattern Lab</a> is a static site generator (powered by either PHP or Node) that stitches together UI components. But there's a whole lot more to it than that!</blockquote>

						<h2>Pattern Lab as a design system</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Build pattern driven user interfaces using atomic design principles</li>
							<li>Include patterns inside each other to create compenets from consistent building blocks</li>
							<li>Pattern documentation - have the entire team using the same language throughout the entire project</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Pattern Lab as an implementation</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>PHP or node version</li>
							<li>Tool agnostic</li>
							<li>Language agnostic</li>
							<li>Viewport resizer, annotations, pattern lineage, and more</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Drupal 8 and Twig</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Big change for frontend workflow in Drupal 8</li>
							<li>Learn more about <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/" target="_blank">Twig</a></li>
							<li>Templating engine that is widely used within the PHP community</li>
							<li>Extends the functionality of PHP templating, eventually compiles down to PHP</li>

					An example of my solution

				<section>
					<section>
						Demonstrate a real life example of Pattern Lab in Drupal 8
					</section>
					<section>
						Consider how templates are being used
					</section>
					<section>
						Inspect how JSON data backs the templates
					</section>
					<section>
						Look at how templates are being built into larger pieces
					</section>
					<section>
						Maybe demo adding a new one
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						How/Why is this useful?
					</section>
					<section>
						Decouples the front end from Drupal! You can theme almost completely OUTSIDE of Drupal if you want.
					</section>
					<section>
						Potentially allows a front end to be functionally built out and designed before a committment to sitebuild is made without losing that time
					</section>
					<section>
						Isolates components into the pieces of responsibility outside of the context of Drupal (wrappers, containers, other element classes, etc)
					</section>
					<section>
						Produces a comprehensive styleguide asset!
					</section>
					<section>
						Provides an entire set of data for all your front end components that does not depend on the database. Comprehensive demonstration of all styles for easy visual "regression testing" of sorts. Especially if you are building complicated components, or items that have many moving parts.
					</section>
					<section>
						Connecting communities! Pattern Lab is an existing tool with a lot of dedicated followers. And with the hard work of a few people, a bridge to connect Drupal with this large existing community has been made. That's pretty cool!
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						Why may this be not ideal for every project?
					</section>
					<section>
						Time - Though, through this talk, I hope we determined that with a reasonable setup, the time investment to use this workflow is not that great. For medium/large projects, or projects that are maintained, it can be well worth it, and save more than the time it takes to create
					</section>
					<section>
						More Tools! - Yes, there are more tools to learn and more things to potentially debug. To effectively use this workflow, the dev has to have a reasonable knowledge of PHP, understanding of twig, a strong understanding of Drupal 8 conventions, experience with front end workflow tools (gulp/grunt), maybe some amount of experience with node, and able to debug any of those parts.
					</section>
					<section>
						Too many tools? It depends on your workflow, and your resources. But this is the direction of the Front End developer in the web space. Tools beyond html/css/javascript are par for the course.
					</section>
					<section>
						End to End project workflow - How does your company work? There are a LOT of potential benefits from this type of workflow, but if your entire project process doesn't/can't adjust to position itself to gain from these benefits than you may strictly be weighing the internal dev benefits against the dev costs.
